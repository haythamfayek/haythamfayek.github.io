<br/>

I am on the faculty of the School of Computing Technologies at the [Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)](https://www.rmit.edu.au), Melbourne, VIC, where I am affiliated with the [Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning (ECML)](https://titan.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e46507/ecml/index.php) group, the [AI Innovation Lab](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/science/research/research-areas/computer-science-and-information-technology/ai-innovation-lab), and the [Centre for Information Discovery and Data Analytics (CIDDA)](https://www.rmit.edu.au/research/centres-collaborations/centre-for-information-discovery-and-data-analytics).

My research interests are broadly in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and machine perception. 
I am primarily interested in learning systems that generalize systematically from limited labelled data.

I was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at [Facebook Research](https://research.fb.com) in Seattle, WA, from August 2018 to January 2020.
I received a PhD from RMIT in 2019.
My PhD thesis is titled, [Continual Deep Learning via Progressive Learning](http://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/eserv/rmit:162646/Fayek.pdf).
During my PhD, I was a Research Intern at Facebook with [Facebook Reality Labs (Oculus VR Research)](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/) and [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/).
I was also a Teaching Assistant and Guest Lecturer at RMIT.
Formerly, I received an MSc (Research) and a BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Petronas University](https://www.utp.edu.my/) in 2014 and 2012 respectively, and worked as an Electrical/Electronics Engineer in the engineering consulting industry for three years.

<!--I was the recipient of the RMIT Vice-Chancellor's PhD Scholarship (VCPS) and the Petronas/MOPE BEng Scholarship.-->
