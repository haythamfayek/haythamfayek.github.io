<br/>

I am a member of the Computer Science and Software Engineering faculty at [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au). 
My research interests are broadly in artificial intelligence, machine learning, machine reasoning, deep learning, continual learning, and machine perception.

I was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at [Facebook Research](https://research.fb.com) in Seattle, WA, from August 2018 to January 2020.

I received a PhD from [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au), Melbourne, VIC, in 2019, advised by [Lawrence Cavedon](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/c/cavedon-professor-lawrence) and [Henry Wu](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/w/wu-professor-hong-ren).
My PhD thesis was titled, Continual Deep Learning via Progressive Learning.
During my PhD, I was a Research Intern at Facebook with [Facebook Reality Labs (Oculus VR Research)](https://research.fb.com/category/augmented-reality-virtual-reality/) and [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/).
I was also a Teaching Assistant and Guest Lecturer at RMIT University.

Formerly, I received an MSc (Research) and a BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Petronas University](https://www.utp.edu.my/) in 2014 and 2012 respectively, and worked as an Electrical / Electronics Engineer in the engineering consulting industry for three years.

I was the recipient of the RMIT Vice-Chancellor's PhD Scholarship (VCPS) and the Petronas / MOPE BEng Scholarship.
