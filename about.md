I am a Vice-Chancellor PhD Student at the School of Engineering, [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au) advised by [Lawrence Cavedon](http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~lcavedon/) and [Henry Wu](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/w/wu-professor-hong-ren).
My research is focused on Deep Learning and Neural Networks and their applications in Speech Recognition.
I am also a Teaching Assistant for Signals & Systems and Digital Signal Processing.

I was a Research Intern at Facebook '16 / '17 (Oculus VR Research & Facebook AI Research (FAIR)) in Seattle.
I formerly received an MSc and a BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Petronas University of Technology](https://www.utp.edu.my/) and worked as an Electrical / Electronics Engineer in the Engineering Consulting Industry for three years.
