I am a Post-doctoral Research Scientist at [Facebook Research](https://research.fb.com), Seattle. My research interests are in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.

Prior, I was a Vice-Chancellor PhD Student at the School of Engineering, [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au), Melbourne, advised by [Lawrence Cavedon](http://goanna.cs.rmit.edu.au/~lcavedon/) and [Henry Wu](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/w/wu-professor-hong-ren).
I was a Research Intern at Facebook, Seattle '16 / '17 with [Facebook Reality Labs (Oculus VR Research)](https://research.fb.com/category/augmented-reality-virtual-reality/) and [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/).
I was a Teaching Assistant for postgraduate Advanced Programming, and undergraduate Image Processing, Signals & Systems II, and Digital Signal Processing I at RMIT.

Formerly, I received an MSc (Research) and a BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Petronas University](https://www.utp.edu.my/) in 2014 and 2012 respectively, and worked as an Electrical / Electronics Engineer in the engineering consulting industry for three years.
