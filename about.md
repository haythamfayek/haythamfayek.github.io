## About

I am a VCPS PhD student at the School of Engineering, [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au).
My research is focused on Deep Learning and Neural Networks and their applications in Speech Processing and Affective Computing. I am also a Teaching Assistant for Digital Signal Processing.

Formerly, I received an MSc and a BEng in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Petronas University of Technology](https://www.utp.edu.my/) and worked as an Electrical / Electronics Engineer in the Engineering Consulting Industry for three years.

I am on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l5T9RtcAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HaythamFayek), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haythamfayek/) & [Github](https://github.com/haythamfayek).
