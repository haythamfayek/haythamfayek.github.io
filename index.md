## About
---
<br/>

I am a Senior Lecturer in the Artificial Intelligence Discipline in the School of Computing Technologies at the [Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University)](https://www.rmit.edu.au) in Melbourne, VIC, where I lead the machine learning and intelligence group and affiliate with the [Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning (ECML) Group](https://titan.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e46507/ecml/index.php), the [AI Innovation Lab](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/science/research/research-areas/computer-science-and-information-technology/ai-innovation-lab), the [Centre for Information Discovery and Data Analytics (CIDDA)](https://www.rmit.edu.au/research/centres-collaborations/centre-for-information-discovery-and-data-analytics), and the [Centre for Industrial AI Research & Innovation (CIARI)](https://www.rmit.edu.au/research/centres-collaborations/centre-for-industrial-ai-research-and-innovation).

I was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at [Meta/Facebook Research](https://research.fb.com) in Seattle, WA, from August 2018 to January 2020.
Prior, I received a PhD from RMIT in 2019.
My PhD thesis is titled, [Continual Deep Learning via Progressive Learning](https://researchrepository.rmit.edu.au/esploro/outputs/9921864066401341).
During my PhD, I was a Research Intern at Facebook with [Facebook Reality Labs (Oculus VR Research)](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/) and [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/).
Formerly, I received an MSc (Research) and a BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, and worked as an Electrical/Electronics Engineer in the engineering consulting industry for three years.

<br/>

## Research
---
<br/>

My research interests are broadly in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and machine perception. 

I am primarily interested in learning systems that systematically generalize from limited labelled data.
This includes learning algorithms that can learn from a limited number of samples by drawing on prior experiences in other tasks and those that can learn despite limitations in labels in uni-modal and multi-modal data.

<!--
I am interested in learning algorithms that can learn from a limited number of samples by drawing on prior experiences which includes transfer learning, multi-task learning, continual learning, and meta-learning.

I am also interested in learning algorithms that can learn despite limitations in labels in data which includes weakly supervised learning, few-shot learning, and self-supervised learning.
