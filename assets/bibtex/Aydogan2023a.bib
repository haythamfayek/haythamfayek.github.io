  abstract = {Developments in flight test data systems have led to an abundance of data which can be harnessed via machine learning for flight load estimations. Main measurements used for the load estimations are strains. However, the transition from strains to loads requires load equations obtained from calibration load tests. Estimated loads obtained by strain data are used for several purposes, from predictive maintenance to development projects. The fidelity of the obtained loads highly affects these activities. Prior research showed that higher accuracy could be achieved with artificial neural network models instead of classical regression analysis. However, the models provided some inaccurate results for some load components during the transition to predicting flight data, and further development is required to improve the flight loads predictions. Using the idea that calibration test data consists of the knowledge of the loads, our aim is to pass on this knowledge to the flight domain to increase the fidelity of the estimated loads. This is possible with machine learning algorithms classified under transfer learning. Transfer learning deals with the transfer of knowledge obtained in one domain to another domain. A load model developed using the calibration test data as a source for training artificial neural networks can be fine-tuned using flight test data, which also includes additional information to increase the accuracy. The research in this paper focuses on applying transfer learning to convey the knowledge in the calibration domain to the flight domain and shows the potential to overcome the poor generalisation in transition to flight in order to achieve high fidelity loads outputs when using such a method.},
