  abstract = {This paper proposes an approach for estimating flight manoeuvre loads based on load calibration test data as modelled using an artificial neural network. Typically, load calibration tests are performed before flight test to obtain load equations, which use strain gauge measurements taken from several locations on an airframe. In the flight test phase, the models derived from the load calibration are used, along with flight measured strains, to estimate the flight manoeuvre loads. In the classical approach, regression analysis techniques are used to calculate load coefficients for the load equations. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence offer an alternative approach to classical methods. In this study, we focus on developing artificial neural network based models with the objective of generalization to flight test data. One type of first-order, second-order and regularized second-order algorithms as optimization methods were investigated. Comparisons were made both with calibration and flight test datasets. In the calibration domain the artificial neural networks produced highly accurate results. In the flight domain it was seen that although artificial neural networks can provide an accurate alternative approach for some loads, they did not achieve high accuracy results for all load components. In addition, a direct relationship between performance in the calibration and flight datasets was not observed, where some models with good generalization in the calibration dataset produced poor generalization in the flight dataset.},
