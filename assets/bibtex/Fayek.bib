	abstract = "Abstract Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) can be regarded as a static or dynamic classification problem, which makes \{SER\} an excellent test bed for investigating and comparing various deep learning architectures. We describe a frame-based formulation to \{SER\} that relies on minimal speech processing and end-to-end deep learning to model intra-utterance dynamics. We use the proposed \{SER\} system to empirically explore feed-forward and recurrent neural network architectures and their variants. Experiments conducted illuminate the advantages and limitations of these architectures in paralinguistic speech recognition and emotion recognition in particular. As a result of our exploration, we report state-of-the-art results on the \{IEMOCAP\} database for speaker-independent \{SER\} and present quantitative and qualitative assessments of the models’ performances.

However, its conventional \{PID\} controller still causes several problems such as poor accuracy in non-linear systems and poor response when there is frequent disturbance. In this research, atuning method for \{PID\} controller,i.e., Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for \{DC\} servomotor is proposed. The paper proposes error and error derivative are oftype 2 fuzzy inputs to the rules and output is the corrective signal to supplement \{PID\} output. Detailed methodology and work results show that both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic tuning offers better response than conventional \{PID\} controller and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic handles uncertainties better that Type-1.Thiscould be used as intelligent control in Rehabilitation Robots. In addition, italso provides promising potentials in robotics and medical applications that require high precision and quick response such as medical diaphragm pump, infusion pump, pharmaceutical dispenser, minimally invasive surgery, etc. "

Multiple schemes and system configurations were studied through eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear time domain simulations. Results demonstrate that wind farms generally had a positive impact on the damping of the undesired electro-mechanical oscillations and overall system stability; however, such positive impact was not achieved in all scenarios.},

The main scheme is to optimize the gains of the controller using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), then optimize only two parameters per type-2 membership function using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The proposed \{OT2FLC\} was implemented in real-time to control the position of a \{DC\} servomotor, which is part of a robotic arm. The performance judgments were carried out based on the Integral Absolute Error (IAE), as well as the computational cost. Various type-2 defuzzification methods were investigated in real-time. A comparative analysis with an Optimal Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Controller (OT1FLC) and a \{PI\} controller, demonstrated OT2FLC׳s superiority; which is evident in handling uncertainty and imprecision induced in the system by means of noise and disturbances.
