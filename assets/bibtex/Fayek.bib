  volume = {92},
  year = {2017},
abstract = {Speech Emotion Recognition ({SER}) can be regarded as a static or dynamic classification problem, which makes {SER} an excellent test bed for investigating and comparing various deep learning architectures. We describe a frame-based formulation to {SER} that relies on minimal speech processing and end-to-end deep learning to model intra-utterance dynamics. We use the proposed {SER} system to empirically explore feed-forward and recurrent neural network architectures and their variants. Experiments conducted illuminate the advantages and limitations of these architectures in paralinguistic speech recognition and emotion recognition in particular. As a result of our exploration, we report state-of-the-art results on the {IEMOCAP} database for speaker-independent {SER} and present quantitative and qualitative assessments of the models’ performances.},

The main scheme is to optimize the gains of the controller using Particle Swarm Optimization ({PSO}), then optimize only two parameters per type-2 membership function using Genetic Algorithm ({GA}). The proposed {OT2FLC} was implemented in real-time to control the position of a {DC} servomotor, which is part of a robotic arm. The performance judgments were carried out based on the Integral Absolute Error ({IAE}), as well as the computational cost. Various type-2 defuzzification methods were investigated in real-time. A comparative analysis with an Optimal Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Controller ({OT1FLC}) and a {PI} controller,
  demonstrated OT2FLC׳s superiority; which is evident in handling uncertainty and imprecision induced in the system by means of noise and disturbances.},

Two types of wind turbine generators were considered and compared against each other, namely the Doubly-Fed Induction Generator ({DFIG}) and the Fixed-Speed Induction Generator ({FSIG}). Multiple schemes and system configurations were studied through eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear time domain simulations. Results demonstrate that wind farms generally had a positive impact on the damping of the undesired electro-mechanical oscillations and overall system stability; however, such positive impact was not achieved in all scenarios.},

  volume = {42},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {{DC} servomotors have been in use extensively for many applications vary from industrial to robotics to consumers. {DC} servomotors provide error feedback signal to its {PID} controller to minimize the error. However, its conventional {PID} controller still causes several problems such as poor accuracy in non-linear systems and poor response when there is frequent disturbance. In this research, a tuning method for {PID} controller, i.e.,
  Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for {DC} servomotor is proposed. The paper proposes error and error derivative are of type 2 fuzzy inputs to the rules and output is the corrective signal to supplement {PID} output. Detailed methodology and work results show that both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic tuning offers better response than conventional {PID} controller and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic handles uncertainties better that Type-1. This could be used as intelligent control in Rehabilitation Robots. In addition, it also provides promising potentials in robotics and medical applications that require high precision and quick response such as medical diaphragm pump, infusion pump, pharmaceutical dispenser, minimally invasive surgery, etc.},
