  abstract = {Over the past decade, the ideologies surrounding Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) have shifted drastically within the aerospace engineering disciplines, predominantly onus to rapid advancements in machine intelligence. While traditional SHM practices are based on scheduled and pre-emptive maintenance, the NextGen SHM system, known commonly as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), has a focus on pro-active condition-based maintenance, forecasting and prognostics â€” a milestone on the trajectory towards Digital Twin technology. In aircraft, particularly defense fighter air platforms, fatigue-critical high-amplitude cyclic behavior is unavoidable, where rapid fatigue life consumption due to an airframe buffet is one of the most problematic phenomena that engineers have encountered throughout the 4th and 5th generation fighter programs. This paper serves as a point-of-reference consolidating a range of machine learning models, under a single benchmark aircraft Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) loads monitoring problem. Linear regression models, traditional (shallow) artificial neural networks, and deep learning strategies are all explored, where strain sensors are used as inputs to predict representative bending and torsional dynamic (buffet) and quasi-static (maneuver) load spectra on an aircraft wing during transonic buffeting maneuvers. For the benchmark system considered herein, the MISO coherence ranges from high to very weak depending on the load case, hereby providing a unique opportunity to rigorously explore the time-series modeling requirements and make valuable recommendations across a wide range of data-qualities that are likely to be encountered in traditional or modern aircraft data-acquisition systems or, for that matter, in any mechanical systems plagued by fatigue.},

This paper presents a data-driven system that processes a number of in-flight acquired signals, such as strain gauge measurements, to predict the airframe service loads using long short-term memory recurrent neural networks. The efficacy of the proposed models is demonstrated using an aircraft flight test dataset. The proposed system can help determine appropriate actions for aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul by enabling predictive condition-based planning of maintenance and procurement of personnel and parts, allowing for more efficient and more sustainable maintenance practices.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a method for buffet load prediction using Frequency Response Functions (FRFs). The system response signals are non-stationary, nonlinear, and time-variant, requiring pre-processing using a hybrid time-frequency transformation, with a subsequent clustering by a hierarchical binning algorithm. The signals include strain gauge measurements, flight parameters, and measured loads and are transformed with a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to derive intervals in which a time-invariant assumption holds. By further clustering the intervals into bins, parameterised by the primary flight conditions, data segments that exhibit dynamically similar behaviour can be concatenated. System identification can then be directly performed on each bin to compute representative FRFs between the inputs (strain gauges) and the outputs (buffet loads). It is shown that the combination of clustering with the FRF approach allows the modelling of the complex relationship between the strains and the loads.},

  abstract = {Multimodal question answering tasks can be used as proxy tasks to study systems that can perceive and reason about the world. Answering questions about different types of input modalities stresses different aspects of reasoning such as visual reasoning, reading comprehension, story understanding, or navigation. In this article, we use the task of Audio Question Answering (AQA) to study the temporal reasoning abilities of machine learning models. To this end, we introduce the Diagnostic Audio Question Answering (DAQA) dataset comprising audio sequences of natural sound events and programmatically generated questions and answers that probe various aspects of temporal reasoning. We adapt several recent state-of-the-art methods for visual question answering to the AQA task, and use DAQA to demonstrate that they perform poorly on questions that require in-depth temporal reasoning. Finally, we propose a new model, Multiple Auxiliary Controllers for Linear Modulation (MALiMo) that extends the recent Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) model and significantly improves its temporal reasoning capabilities. We envisage DAQA to foster research on AQA and temporal reasoning and MALiMo a step towards models for AQA.},

  abstract = {Continual learning is the ability of a learning system to solve new tasks by utilizing previously acquired knowledge from learning and performing prior tasks without having significant adverse effects on the acquired prior knowledge. Continual learning is key to advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence. Progressive learning is a deep learning framework for continual learning that comprises three procedures: curriculum, progression, and pruning. The curriculum procedure is used to actively select a task to learn from a set of candidate tasks. The progression procedure is used to grow the capacity of the model by adding new parameters that leverage parameters learned in prior tasks, while learning from data available for the new task at hand, without being susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. The pruning procedure is used to counteract the growth in the number of parameters as further tasks are learned, as well as to mitigate negative forward transfer, in which prior knowledge unrelated to the task at hand may interfere and worsen performance. Progressive learning is evaluated on a number of supervised classification tasks in the image recognition and speech recognition domains to demonstrate its advantages compared with baseline methods. It is shown that, when tasks are related, progressive learning leads to faster learning that converges to better generalization performance using a smaller number of dedicated parameters.},

We use the proposed {SER} system to empirically explore feed-forward and recurrent neural network architectures and their variants. Experiments conducted illuminate the advantages and limitations of these architectures in paralinguistic speech recognition and emotion recognition in particular. As a result of our exploration, we report state-of-the-art results on the {IEMOCAP} database for speaker-independent {SER} and present quantitative and qualitative assessments of the modelsâ€™ performances.},

  abstract = {{DC} servomotors have been in use extensively for many applications vary from industrial to robotics to consumers. {DC} servomotors provide error feedback signal to its {PID} controller to minimize the error. However, its conventional {PID} controller still causes several problems such as poor accuracy in non-linear systems and poor response when there is frequent disturbance. In this research, a tuning method for {PID} controller, i.e.,
  Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for {DC} servomotor is proposed. The paper proposes error and error derivative are of type 2 fuzzy inputs to the rules and output is the corrective signal to supplement {PID} output. Detailed methodology and work results show that both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic tuning offers better response than conventional {PID} controller and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic handles uncertainties better that Type-1. This could be used as intelligent control in Rehabilitation Robots. In addition, it also provides promising potentials in robotics and medical applications that require high precision and quick response such as medical diaphragm pump, infusion pump, pharmaceutical dispenser, minimally invasive surgery, etc.},
