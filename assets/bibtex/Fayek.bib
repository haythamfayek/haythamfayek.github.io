  abstract = {Multimodal question answering tasks can be used as proxy tasks to study systems that can perceive and reason about the world. Answering questions about different types of input modalities stresses different aspects of reasoning such as visual reasoning, reading comprehension, story understanding, or navigation. In this article, we use the task of Audio Question Answering (AQA) to study the temporal reasoning abilities of machine learning models. To this end, we introduce the Diagnostic Audio Question Answering (DAQA) dataset comprising audio sequences of natural sound events and programmatically generated questions and answers that probe various aspects of temporal reasoning. We adapt several recent state-of-the-art methods for visual question answering to the AQA task, and use DAQA to demonstrate that they perform poorly on questions that require in-depth temporal reasoning. Finally, we propose a new model, Multiple Auxiliary Controllers for Linear Modulation (MALiMo) that extends the recent Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) model and significantly improves its temporal reasoning capabilities. We envisage DAQA to foster research on AQA and temporal reasoning and MALiMo a step towards models for AQA.},

  abstract = {Continual learning is the ability of a learning system to solve new tasks by utilizing previously acquired knowledge from learning and performing prior tasks without having significant adverse effects on the acquired prior knowledge. Continual learning is key to advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence. Progressive learning is a deep learning framework for continual learning that comprises three procedures: curriculum, progression, and pruning. The curriculum procedure is used to actively select a task to learn from a set of candidate tasks. The progression procedure is used to grow the capacity of the model by adding new parameters that leverage parameters learned in prior tasks, while learning from data available for the new task at hand, without being susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. The pruning procedure is used to counteract the growth in the number of parameters as further tasks are learned, as well as to mitigate negative forward transfer, in which prior knowledge unrelated to the task at hand may interfere and worsen performance. Progressive learning is evaluated on a number of supervised classification tasks in the image recognition and speech recognition domains to demonstrate its advantages compared with baseline methods. It is shown that, when tasks are related, progressive learning leads to faster learning that converges to better generalization performance using a smaller number of dedicated parameters.},

  abstract = {Speech Emotion Recognition ({SER}) can be regarded as a static or dynamic classification problem, which makes {SER} an excellent test bed for investigating and comparing various deep learning architectures. We describe a frame-based formulation to {SER} that relies on minimal speech processing and end-to-end deep learning to model intra-utterance dynamics. We use the proposed {SER} system to empirically explore feed-forward and recurrent neural network architectures and their variants. Experiments conducted illuminate the advantages and limitations of these architectures in paralinguistic speech recognition and emotion recognition in particular. As a result of our exploration, we report state-of-the-art results on the {IEMOCAP} database for speaker-independent {SER} and present quantitative and qualitative assessments of the models’ performances.},

The main scheme is to optimize the gains of the controller using Particle Swarm Optimization ({PSO}), then optimize only two parameters per type-2 membership function using Genetic Algorithm ({GA}). The proposed {OT2FLC} was implemented in real-time to control the position of a {DC} servomotor, which is part of a robotic arm. The performance judgments were carried out based on the Integral Absolute Error ({IAE}), as well as the computational cost. Various type-2 defuzzification methods were investigated in real-time. A comparative analysis with an Optimal Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Controller ({OT1FLC}) and a {PI} controller,
  demonstrated OT2FLC׳s superiority; which is evident in handling uncertainty and imprecision induced in the system by means of noise and disturbances.},

Two types of wind turbine generators were considered and compared against each other, namely the Doubly-Fed Induction Generator ({DFIG}) and the Fixed-Speed Induction Generator ({FSIG}). Multiple schemes and system configurations were studied through eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear time domain simulations. Results demonstrate that wind farms generally had a positive impact on the damping of the undesired electro-mechanical oscillations and overall system stability; however, such positive impact was not achieved in all scenarios.},

  abstract = {{DC} servomotors have been in use extensively for many applications vary from industrial to robotics to consumers. {DC} servomotors provide error feedback signal to its {PID} controller to minimize the error. However, its conventional {PID} controller still causes several problems such as poor accuracy in non-linear systems and poor response when there is frequent disturbance. In this research, a tuning method for {PID} controller, i.e.,
  Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for {DC} servomotor is proposed. The paper proposes error and error derivative are of type 2 fuzzy inputs to the rules and output is the corrective signal to supplement {PID} output. Detailed methodology and work results show that both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic tuning offers better response than conventional {PID} controller and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic handles uncertainties better that Type-1. This could be used as intelligent control in Rehabilitation Robots. In addition, it also provides promising potentials in robotics and medical applications that require high precision and quick response such as medical diaphragm pump, infusion pump, pharmaceutical dispenser, minimally invasive surgery, etc.},
