  abstract = {The measurement of player engagement has been the concern of academics and industry professionals alike. Specifically, there is interest towards the best way to measure engagement through surveys or questionnaires. Recently, a new tool was published that attempts to measure workload experienced during video game play, however, it has thus far only been used for exploring the retrospective recollection of gameplay. In this paper, we present, for the first time, a proof of concept study of the test-retest reliability of the Video Game Demand Scale (VGDS) and NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) during natural gameplay with Minecraft. Surveys were administered immediately after gameplay, and then once again approximately one month later. The participants completed a building task in Minecraft whilst being assisted by a companion. Results revealed some test-retest reliability of the VGDS and NASA-TLX, as well as strong correlations between the totals at the two time points. This work is an initial starting point for exploring the test-retest reliability of subjective measures, and as such further experiments are planned and underway to gain a broader understanding of VGDS and NASA-TLX in this context.},

Numerous approaches were developed to achieve this ability while avoiding the well-known problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. This chapter reviews a number of architectural approaches to continual learning in neural networks which tackle the problem by modifying the architecture of the neural network, for example, by adding new adaptive parameters to the model for each new task. The architectural paradigm for continual learning in neural networks can potentially completely eliminate the problem of catastrophic forgetting and maintain competitive performance, often at the expense of increased computational complexity.},

Extraction and utilization of these representations are vital when data are no longer available in the future, especially in a continual learning scenario. Flashcards are visual representations that capture the encoded knowledge of a network as a recursive function of some predefined random image patterns. In a continual learning scenario, flashcards help prevent catastrophic forgetting by consolidating the knowledge of all the previous tasks. Flashcards are required to be constructed only before learning the subsequent task and are hence independent of the number of tasks trained previously, making them task-agnostic. The efficacy of flashcards in capturing learned knowledge representation (as an alternative to the original data) is empirically validated on a variety of continual learning tasks: reconstruction, denoising and task-incremental classification, using several heterogeneous (varying background and complexity) benchmark datasets. Experimental evidence indicates that flashcards as a replay strategy are task-agnostic, perform better than generative replay and are on par with episodic replay without additional memory overhead.},

  abstract = {The fatigue cracks in a fighter aircraft that pose the greatest threat to structural integrity and availability are usually less than 1mm for most of their lives. However, it has long been recognised that small cracks can grow significantly faster than long cracks at the same stress intensity range (ΔK). This means predictions for small cracks growing under realistic spectrum loading can be significantly non-conservative when using linear elastic fracture mechanics and long crack-based empirical rate data. Previous work showed empirical rate data based on small cracks grown under constant amplitude (CA) loading could significantly improve predictions. However, such data still have limitations related to an inability to predict the spectrum history effects that influence small cracks. This paper presents a method to optimise a model to predict fatigue crack growth rates for cracks loaded with realistic spectra. This method is demonstrated for small cracks in Aluminium Alloy 7050-T7451 grown under fighter wing root spectrum loading. Numerical optimisation is used to select model parameters that minimise fatigue crack growth rate prediction errors for a training dataset. This purpose-built model consistently outperformed a generic model based on the growth of small cracks under CA loading.},

Previous studies focused on studying bias in opinion summarisation using extractive models, but limited research has paid attention to abstractive summarisation models. In this study, using political bias as a case study, we first establish a methodology to quantify bias in abstractive models, then trace it from the pre-trained models to the task of summarising social media opinions using different models and adaptation methods. We find that most models exhibit intrinsic bias. Using a social media text summarisation dataset and contrasting various adaptation methods, we find that tuning a smaller number of parameters is less biased compared to standard fine-tuning; however, the diversity of topics in training data used for fine-tuning is critical.},

In addition, we examine opinion similarity, a measure of how closely related two opinions are in terms of their stance on a given topic, and its relationship with opinion diversity. Through the lense of stances towards a topic, we examine opinion diversity and similarity using three debatable topics under COVID-19. Experimental results on these topics revealed that a higher degree of similarity of opinions did not indicate good diversity or fairly cover the various opinions originally presented in the source documents.

  abstract = {Recent developments in Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS) have undoubtedly increased mission value due to the ability to reconfigure the spacecraft cluster/formation and incrementally add new or update older satellites in the formation. These features provide inherent benefits, such as increased mission effectiveness, multi-mission capabilities, design flexibility, and so on. Trusted Autonomous Satellite Operation (TASO) are possible owing to the predictive and reactive integrity features offered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), including both on-board satellites and in the ground control segments. To effectively monitor and manage time-critical events such as disaster relief missions, the DSS must be able to reconfigure autonomously. To achieve TASO, the DSS should have reconfiguration capability within the architecture and spacecraft should communicate with each other through an Inter-Satellite Link (ISL). Recent advances in AI, sensing, and computing technologies have resulted in the development of new promising concepts for the safe and efficient operation of the DSS. The combination of these technologies enables trusted autonomy in intelligent DSS (iDSS) operations, allowing for a more responsive and resilient approach to Space Mission Management (SMM) in terms of data collection and processing, especially when using state-of-the-art optical sensors. This research looks into the potential applications of iDSS by proposing a constellation of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for near-real-time wildfire management. For spacecraft to continuously monitor Areas of Interest (AOI) in a dynamically changing environment, satellite missions must have extensive coverage, revisit intervals, and reconfiguration capability that iDSS can offer. Our recent work demonstrated the feasibility of AI-based data processing using state-of-the-art on-board astrionics hardware accelerators. Based on these initial results, AI-based software has been successively developed for wildfire detection on-board iDSS satellites. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed iDSS architecture, simulation case studies are performed considering different geographic locations.},

  abstract = {Personalized video games have the potential to provide unique and meaningful experiences for the player. User data taken from biosensors, questionnaires, or in-game performance data can infer a player’s psychological state, to which relevant game features can be adapted to enhance the player experience. This survey discusses the data types, game elements, and methods that have been used thus far to create adaptive experiences in games. The survey specifically focuses on personalized nonplayer character (NPC) companions through adaptation. Studies using performance data, affect and cognition, and self-reports to adapt companions and other NPC types are reviewed for their success in providing an enhanced experience. We then provide a motivation for a personalized companion before detailing a framework for an adaptive system that modifies companion characteristics based on the player’s state. This framework takes a human-centered approach to personalized companion design; it proposes the game elements appropriate for adaptation, the data types that suit the adaptation of the companion type, the techniques that would enable successful adaptation, and methods for companion evaluation. The framework firstly quantifies the companion’s behaviour according to recent companion design architecture. Following this, the companion’s characteristics are updated according to the player state, previous player states, evaluations of changes, and the player model. The last phase highlights how to evaluate the companion during the design stage to ensure that it is reliable in assisting the player. We suggest this as a starting point for game designers when considering how to approach a companion that aims to enhance and sustain player experience.},

  abstract = {One of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals is climate action (SDG-13), and wildfire is among the catastrophic events that both impact climate change and are aggravated by it. In Australia and other countries, large-scale wildfires have dramatically grown in frequency and size in recent years. These fires threaten the world&rsquo;s forests and urban woods, cause enormous environmental and property damage, and quite often result in fatalities. As a result of their increasing frequency, there is an ongoing debate over how to handle catastrophic wildfires and mitigate their social, economic, and environmental repercussions. Effective prevention, early warning, and response strategies must be well-planned and carefully coordinated to minimise harmful consequences to people and the environment. Rapid advancements in remote sensing technologies such as ground-based, aerial surveillance vehicle-based, and satellite-based systems have been used for efficient wildfire surveillance. This study focuses on the application of space-borne technology for very accurate fire detection under challenging conditions. Due to the significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in recent years, numerous studies have previously been conducted to examine how AI might be applied in various situations. As a result of its special physical and operational requirements, spaceflight has emerged as one of the most challenging application fields. This work contains a feasibility study as well as a model and scenario prototype for a satellite AI system. With the intention of swiftly generating alerts and enabling immediate actions, the detection of wildfires has been studied with reference to the Australian events that occurred in December 2019. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed, trained, and used from the ground up to detect wildfires while also adjusting their complexity to meet onboard implementation requirements for trusted autonomous satellite operations (TASO). The capability of a 1-dimensional convolution neural network (1-DCNN) to classify wildfires is demonstrated in this research and the results are assessed against those reported in the literature. In order to enable autonomous onboard data processing, various hardware accelerators were considered and evaluated for onboard implementation. The trained model was then implemented in the following: Intel Movidius NCS-2 and Nvidia Jetson Nano and Nvidia Jetson TX2. Using the selected onboard hardware, the developed model was then put into practice and analysis was carried out. The results were positive and in favour of using the technology that has been proposed for onboard data processing to enable TASO on future missions. The findings indicate that data processing onboard can be very beneficial in disaster management and climate change mitigation by facilitating the generation of timely alerts for users and by enabling rapid and appropriate responses.},

  abstract = {Structural health management for Defence aerospace platforms is traditionally driven by scheduled inspection intervals and pre-emptive maintenance based on the interpretation of structural certification test results or reactive based on unique or unexpected fleet in-service incidents. However, a major shift towards proactive condition-based maintenance is required to improve availability and reduce fleet management and sustainment costs. Significant improvements to aerospace vehicle performance and structural health monitoring can be achieved by implementing an integrated approach to vehicle operation and sustainment. Numerous uncertainty factors and safety margins used in structural integrity assessment can be minimised or even eliminated by integrating a high-fidelity numerical model of the vehicle with a “smart” health monitoring system and a comprehensive historical database for each individual vehicle covering its operation, maintenance, upgrades and repairs. Identifying and tracking the global airframe health as well as local structural anomalies caused by fatigue and wear is a crucial component towards the development of a smart structural diagnostics capability to support the operation and sustainment of the current and future aerospace platforms. This paper describes the progress of a collaborative effort between the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) and RMIT University in developing a high-fidelity approach to structural health monitoring and individual aircraft tracking inspired by the Digital Twin paradigm. Operational Load Analysis and Asset Diagnostics (aka OPERAND) is a multi-physics analysis suite based on integrating current state-of-the-art software techniques, data-driven methods, and model-based approaches. This innovative structural diagnostic and prognostic framework has the potential to considerably improve fleet airworthiness management, provide substantial savings to fleet operators and optimise aerospace vehicle availability for enhanced operational effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Developments in flight test data systems have led to an abundance of data which can be harnessed via machine learning for flight load estimations. Main measurements used for the load estimations are strains. However, the transition from strains to loads requires load equations obtained from calibration load tests. Estimated loads obtained by strain data are used for several purposes, from predictive maintenance to development projects. The fidelity of the obtained loads highly affects these activities. Prior research showed that higher accuracy could be achieved with artificial neural network models instead of classical regression analysis. However, the models provided some inaccurate results for some load components during the transition to predicting flight data, and further development is required to improve the flight loads predictions. Using the idea that calibration test data consists of the knowledge of the loads, our aim is to pass on this knowledge to the flight domain to increase the fidelity of the estimated loads. This is possible with machine learning algorithms classified under transfer learning. Transfer learning deals with the transfer of knowledge obtained in one domain to another domain. A load model developed using the calibration test data as a source for training artificial neural networks can be fine-tuned using flight test data, which also includes additional information to increase the accuracy. The research in this paper focuses on applying transfer learning to convey the knowledge in the calibration domain to the flight domain and shows the potential to overcome the poor generalisation in transition to flight in order to achieve high fidelity loads outputs when using such a method.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an approach for estimating flight manoeuvre loads based on load calibration test data as modelled using an artificial neural network. Typically, load calibration tests are performed before flight test to obtain load equations, which use strain gauge measurements taken from several locations on an airframe. In the flight test phase, the models derived from the load calibration are used, along with flight measured strains, to estimate the flight manoeuvre loads. In the classical approach, regression analysis techniques are used to calculate load coefficients for the load equations. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence offer an alternative approach to classical methods. In this study, we focus on developing artificial neural network based models with the objective of generalization to flight test data. One type of first-order, second-order and regularized second-order algorithms as optimization methods were investigated. Comparisons were made both with calibration and flight test datasets. In the calibration domain the artificial neural networks produced highly accurate results. In the flight domain it was seen that although artificial neural networks can provide an accurate alternative approach for some loads, they did not achieve high accuracy results for all load components. In addition, a direct relationship between performance in the calibration and flight datasets was not observed, where some models with good generalization in the calibration dataset produced poor generalization in the flight dataset.},

  abstract = {Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to automate architecture engineering in neural networks. This often requires a high computational overhead to evaluate a number of candidate networks from the set of all possible networks in the search space during the search. Prediction of the networks' performance can alleviate this high computational overhead by mitigating the need for evaluating every candidate network. Developing such a predictor typically requires a large number of evaluated architectures which may be difficult to obtain. We address this challenge by proposing a novel evolutionary-based NAS strategy, Predictor-assisted E-NAS (PRE-NAS), which can perform well even with an extremely small number of evaluated architectures. PRE-NAS leverages new evolutionary search strategies and integrates high-fidelity weight inheritance over generations. Unlike one-shot strategies, which may suffer from bias in the evaluation due to weight sharing, offspring candidates in PRE-NAS are topologically homogeneous, which circumvents bias and leads to more accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS search spaces show that PRE-NAS can outperform state-of-the-art NAS methods. With only a single GPU searching for 0.6 days, competitive architecture can be found by PRE-NAS which achieves 2.40\% and 24\% test error rates on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet respectively.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, the ideologies surrounding Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) have shifted drastically within the aerospace engineering disciplines, predominantly onus to rapid advancements in machine intelligence. While traditional SHM practices are based on scheduled and pre-emptive maintenance, the NextGen SHM system, known commonly as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), has a focus on pro-active condition-based maintenance, forecasting and prognostics — a milestone on the trajectory towards Digital Twin technology. In aircraft, particularly defense fighter air platforms, fatigue-critical high-amplitude cyclic behavior is unavoidable, where rapid fatigue life consumption due to an airframe buffet is one of the most problematic phenomena that engineers have encountered throughout the 4th and 5th generation fighter programs. This paper serves as a point-of-reference consolidating a range of machine learning models, under a single benchmark aircraft Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) loads monitoring problem. Linear regression models, traditional (shallow) artificial neural networks, and deep learning strategies are all explored, where strain sensors are used as inputs to predict representative bending and torsional dynamic (buffet) and quasi-static (maneuver) load spectra on an aircraft wing during transonic buffeting maneuvers. For the benchmark system considered herein, the MISO coherence ranges from high to very weak depending on the load case, hereby providing a unique opportunity to rigorously explore the time-series modeling requirements and make valuable recommendations across a wide range of data-qualities that are likely to be encountered in traditional or modern aircraft data-acquisition systems or, for that matter, in any mechanical systems plagued by fatigue.},

The system response signals are non-stationary, nonlinear, and time-variant, requiring pre-processing using a hybrid time-frequency transformation, with a subsequent clustering by a hierarchical binning algorithm. The signals include strain gauge measurements, flight parameters, and measured loads and are transformed with a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to derive intervals in which a time-invariant assumption holds. By further clustering the intervals into bins, parameterised by the primary flight conditions, data segments that exhibit dynamically similar behaviour can be concatenated. System identification can then be directly performed on each bin to compute representative FRFs between the inputs (strain gauges) and the outputs (buffet loads). It is shown that the combination of clustering with the FRF approach allows the modelling of the complex relationship between the strains and the loads.},

In this article, we use the task of Audio Question Answering (AQA) to study the temporal reasoning abilities of machine learning models. To this end, we introduce the Diagnostic Audio Question Answering (DAQA) dataset comprising audio sequences of natural sound events and programmatically generated questions and answers that probe various aspects of temporal reasoning. We adapt several recent state-of-the-art methods for visual question answering to the AQA task, and use DAQA to demonstrate that they perform poorly on questions that require in-depth temporal reasoning. Finally, we propose a new model, Multiple Auxiliary Controllers for Linear Modulation (MALiMo) that extends the recent Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) model and significantly improves its temporal reasoning capabilities. We envisage DAQA to foster research on AQA and temporal reasoning and MALiMo a step towards models for AQA.},

  abstract = {Continual learning is the ability of a learning system to solve new tasks by utilizing previously acquired knowledge from learning and performing prior tasks without having significant adverse effects on the acquired prior knowledge. Continual learning is key to advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence. Progressive learning is a deep learning framework for continual learning that comprises three procedures: curriculum, progression, and pruning. The curriculum procedure is used to actively select a task to learn from a set of candidate tasks. The progression procedure is used to grow the capacity of the model by adding new parameters that leverage parameters learned in prior tasks, while learning from data available for the new task at hand, without being susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. The pruning procedure is used to counteract the growth in the number of parameters as further tasks are learned, as well as to mitigate negative forward transfer, in which prior knowledge unrelated to the task at hand may interfere and worsen performance. Progressive learning is evaluated on a number of supervised classification tasks in the image recognition and speech recognition domains to demonstrate its advantages compared with baseline methods. It is shown that, when tasks are related, progressive learning leads to faster learning that converges to better generalization performance using a smaller number of dedicated parameters.},
