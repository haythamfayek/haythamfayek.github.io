  abstract = {Structural health management for Defence aerospace platforms is traditionally driven by scheduled inspection intervals and pre-emptive maintenance based on the interpretation of structural certification test results or reactive based on unique or unexpected fleet in-service incidents. However, a major shift towards proactive condition-based maintenance is required to improve availability and reduce fleet management and sustainment costs. Significant improvements to aerospace vehicle performance and structural health monitoring can be achieved by implementing an integrated approach to vehicle operation and sustainment. Numerous uncertainty factors and safety margins used in structural integrity assessment can be minimised or even eliminated by integrating a high-fidelity numerical model of the vehicle with a “smart” health monitoring system and a comprehensive historical database for each individual vehicle covering its operation, maintenance, upgrades and repairs. Identifying and tracking the global airframe health as well as local structural anomalies caused by fatigue and wear is a crucial component towards the development of a smart structural diagnostics capability to support the operation and sustainment of the current and future aerospace platforms. This paper describes the progress of a collaborative effort between the Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) and RMIT University in developing a high-fidelity approach to structural health monitoring and individual aircraft tracking inspired by the Digital Twin paradigm. Operational Load Analysis and Asset Diagnostics (aka OPERAND) is a multi-physics analysis suite based on integrating current state-of-the-art software techniques, data-driven methods, and model-based approaches. This innovative structural diagnostic and prognostic framework has the potential to considerably improve fleet airworthiness management, provide substantial savings to fleet operators and optimise aerospace vehicle availability for enhanced operational effectiveness.},
