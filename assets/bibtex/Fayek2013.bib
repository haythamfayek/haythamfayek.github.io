  abstract = {This paper presents the design and real-time implementation of a Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Proportional-Integral Controller ({T2FLPIC}) to control the position of a DC servomotor, which controls a robotic arm. Numerous type-2 defuzzification methods were implemented and judged against each other. A comparative analysis with the conventional Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Proportional-Integral Controller ({T1FLPIC}) and a {PID} controller demonstrates that the {T2FLPIC} has much improved performance than the {T1FLPIC} and the {PID} controller. This improvement is evident when it comes to handling of system disturbances and noise.},
