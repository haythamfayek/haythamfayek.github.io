	abstract = "Abstract \{DC\} servomotors have been in use extensively for many applications vary from industrial to robotics to consumers. \{DC\} servomotors provide error feedback signal to its \{PID\} controller to minimize the error. However, its conventional \{PID\} controller still causes several problems such as poor accuracy in non-linear systems and poor response when there is frequent disturbance. In this research, atuning method for \{PID\} controller,i.e., Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic for \{DC\} servomotor is proposed. The paper proposes error and error derivative are oftype 2 fuzzy inputs to the rules and output is the corrective signal to supplement \{PID\} output. Detailed methodology and work results show that both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic tuning offers better response than conventional \{PID\} controller and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic handles uncertainties better that Type-1.Thiscould be used as intelligent control in Rehabilitation Robots. In addition, italso provides promising potentials in robotics and medical applications that require high precision and quick response such as medical diaphragm pump, infusion pump, pharmaceutical dispenser, minimally invasive surgery, etc. "
