  abstract = {A computationally-efficient systematic procedure to design an Optimal Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller (OT2FLC) is proposed. The main scheme is to optimize the gains of the controller using Particle Swarm Optimization ({PSO}), then optimize only two parameters per type-2 membership function using Genetic Algorithm ({GA}). The proposed {OT2FLC} was implemented in real-time to control the position of a {DC} servomotor, which is part of a robotic arm. The performance judgments were carried out based on the Integral Absolute Error ({IAE}), as well as the computational cost. Various type-2 defuzzification methods were investigated in real-time. A comparative analysis with an Optimal Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Controller ({OT1FLC}) and a {PI} controller,
  demonstrated OT2FLC×³s superiority; which is evident in handling uncertainty and imprecision induced in the system by means of noise and disturbances.},
