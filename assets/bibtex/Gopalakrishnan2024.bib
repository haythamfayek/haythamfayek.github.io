  abstract = {Deep neural networks model data for a task or a sequence of tasks, where the knowledge extracted from the data is encoded in the parameters and representations of the network. Extraction and utilization of these representations are vital when data are no longer available in the future, especially in a continual learning scenario. Flashcards are visual representations that capture the encoded knowledge of a network as a recursive function of some predefined random image patterns. In a continual learning scenario, flashcards help prevent catastrophic forgetting by consolidating the knowledge of all the previous tasks. Flashcards are required to be constructed only before learning the subsequent task and are hence independent of the number of tasks trained previously, making them task-agnostic. The efficacy of flashcards in capturing learned knowledge representation (as an alternative to the original data) is empirically validated on a variety of continual learning tasks: reconstruction, denoising and task-incremental classification, using several heterogeneous (varying background and complexity) benchmark datasets. Experimental evidence indicates that flashcards as a replay strategy are task-agnostic, perform better than generative replay and are on par with episodic replay without additional memory overhead.},
