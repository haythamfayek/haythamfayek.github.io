  abstract = {The measurement of player engagement has been the concern of academics and industry professionals alike. Specifically, there is interest towards the best way to measure engagement through surveys or questionnaires. Recently, a new tool was published that attempts to measure workload experienced during video game play, however, it has thus far only been used for exploring the retrospective recollection of gameplay. In this paper, we present, for the first time, a proof of concept study of the test-retest reliability of the Video Game Demand Scale (VGDS) and NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) during natural gameplay with Minecraft. Surveys were administered immediately after gameplay, and then once again approximately one month later. The participants completed a building task in Minecraft whilst being assisted by a companion. Results revealed some test-retest reliability of the VGDS and NASA-TLX, as well as strong correlations between the totals at the two time points. This work is an initial starting point for exploring the test-retest reliability of subjective measures, and as such further experiments are planned and underway to gain a broader understanding of VGDS and NASA-TLX in this context.},
