  abstract = {Contemporary approaches for aircraft structural prognostics and health management are more pro-active, condition-based, relying on the current or forecasted condition of the structure. This paper presents a data-driven system that processes a number of in-flight acquired signals, such as strain gauge measurements, to predict the airframe service loads using long short-term memory recurrent neural networks. The efficacy of the proposed models is demonstrated using an aircraft flight test dataset. The proposed system can help determine appropriate actions for aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul by enabling predictive condition-based planning of maintenance and procurement of personnel and parts, allowing for more efficient and more sustainable maintenance practices.},
