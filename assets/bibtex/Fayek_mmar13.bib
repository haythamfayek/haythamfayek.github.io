	abstract = {This paper presents the design and real-time implementation of a Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Proportional-Integral Controller (T2FLPIC) to control the position of a DC servomotor, which controls a robotic arm. Numerous type-2 defuzzification methods were implemented and judged against each other. A comparative analysis with the conventional Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Proportional-Integral Controller (T1FLPIC) and a PID controller demonstrates that the T2FLPIC has much improved performance than the T1FLPIC and the PID controller. This improvement is evident when it comes to handling of system disturbances and noise.},
