  abstract = {This paper describes a method for buffet load prediction using Frequency Response Functions (FRFs). The system response signals are non-stationary, nonlinear, and time-variant, requiring pre-processing using a hybrid time-frequency transformation, with a subsequent clustering by a hierarchical binning algorithm. The signals include strain gauge measurements, flight parameters, and measured loads and are transformed with a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to derive intervals in which a time-invariant assumption holds. By further clustering the intervals into bins, parameterised by the primary flight conditions, data segments that exhibit dynamically similar behaviour can be concatenated. System identification can then be directly performed on each bin to compute representative FRFs between the inputs (strain gauges) and the outputs (buffet loads). It is shown that the combination of clustering with the FRF approach allows the modelling of the complex relationship between the strains and the loads.},
