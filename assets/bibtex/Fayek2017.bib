  abstract = {Speech Emotion Recognition ({SER}) can be regarded as a static or dynamic classification problem, which makes {SER} an excellent test bed for investigating and comparing various deep learning architectures. We describe a frame-based formulation to {SER} that relies on minimal speech processing and end-to-end deep learning to model intra-utterance dynamics. We use the proposed {SER} system to empirically explore feed-forward and recurrent neural network architectures and their variants. Experiments conducted illuminate the advantages and limitations of these architectures in paralinguistic speech recognition and emotion recognition in particular. As a result of our exploration, we report state-of-the-art results on the {IEMOCAP} database for speaker-independent {SER} and present quantitative and qualitative assessments of the models’ performances.},
