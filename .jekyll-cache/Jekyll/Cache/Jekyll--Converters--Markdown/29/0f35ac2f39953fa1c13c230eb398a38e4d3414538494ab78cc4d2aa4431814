<p>I am on the faculty of the School of Computing Technologies at the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au">Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)</a>, Melbourne, VIC, where I am affiliated with the <a href="https://titan.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e46507/ecml/index.php">Evolutionary Computing and Machine Learning (ECML)</a> group, the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/science/research/research-areas/computer-science-and-information-technology/ai-innovation-lab">AI Innovation Lab</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/research/centres-collaborations/centre-for-information-discovery-and-data-analytics">Centre for Information Discovery and Data Analytics (CIDDA)</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests are broadly in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and machine perception. 
I am primarily interested in learning systems that generalize systematically from limited labelled data.</p>

<p>I was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at <a href="https://research.fb.com">Facebook Research</a> in Seattle, WA, from August 2018 to January 2020.
I received a PhD from RMIT in 2019.
My PhD thesis is titled, <a href="http://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/eserv/rmit:162646/Fayek.pdf">Continual Deep Learning via Progressive Learning</a>.
During my PhD, I was a Research Intern at Facebook with <a href="https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/">Facebook Reality Labs (Oculus VR Research)</a> and <a href="https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research-fair/">Facebook AI Research (FAIR)</a>.
I was also a Teaching Assistant and Guest Lecturer at RMIT.
Formerly, I received an MSc (Research) and a BEng (Hons) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from <a href="https://www.utp.edu.my/">Petronas University</a> in 2014 and 2012 respectively, and worked as an Electrical/Electronics Engineer in the engineering consulting industry for three years.</p>

<!--I was the recipient of the RMIT Vice-Chancellor's PhD Scholarship (VCPS) and the Petronas/MOPE BEng Scholarship.-->
